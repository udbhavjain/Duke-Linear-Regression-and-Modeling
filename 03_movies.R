  runtime: Higher is preferable, but not by much.
  
  theatre release year: Older movies have higher ratings, but not by much.
  
  critic rating: Movies rated as 'Certified Fresh' have the highest audience scores. 
  Movies rated as 'Rotten' are next in popularity, and 'Fresh' movies are the least liked.

  critic score: The audience score rises with the critic score.

  best picture nomination: Movies nominated for 'best picture' have much higher ratings

  best actress award winner: Ratings seem to be lower for movies that feature actresses 
  who have won the best actress award.
